# llm-news-app
LLM, AI powered news source based on Python Google News web scraping.

Uses ollama to run model and gnews library for web scraping. Prompt engineering to get the LLM to act and format in the right way.

## Why?
Many people don't have the time/attention to read a whole article and research different viewpoints. Talking about news with an LLM can speed up the process and help users gain a deeper understanding than just reading.
